## 📊 Netflix Movie Analysis – AI6 Saturday Assessment

### 📝 Overview
This notebook explores a dataset of Netflix titles to build a classification model that predicts whether a title is a **Movie** or a **TV Show** based on its **duration** and **release year**.

### 🔍 Key Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Extracted numeric duration values and cleaned missing data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selected relevant features (`duration_num`, `release_year`) and encoded the target variable (`type`).
- **Modeling**: Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` using `scikit-learn`.
- **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using classification metrics.
- **Visualization**: Displayed feature importance using a horizontal bar chart.

### 📈 Results
The model provides insights into which features most influence the classification between Movies and TV Shows. Feature importance visualization highlights the relative impact of duration and release year.

### 📂 Dataset Source
This analysis is based on the publicly available [Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). The dataset includes metadata such as title, type, cast, director, country, release year, duration, and rating.
